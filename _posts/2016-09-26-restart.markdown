One of my goals is to become a better writer and communicator, perhaps
writing a book eventually.

To this end, I've downloaded a habit tracker called [Loop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&hl=en)
where hopefully I will incentivize myself to write a blog post every week even
if it's short.
Though I do intend to try and stick to technical topics.
I've tried habit trackers like Habitica in the past, but the web interfaces
are clunky and I've definitely fallen prey to the [overjustification effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect)
which I learned about from the [College Info Geek podcast](http://collegeinfogeek.com/habits-routines-motivation-strategies/)

My other habits to track are generally going to the gym, which I am doing using
the Stronglifts app (which, for the paid version, conveniently integrates with Google Fit)
I also am tracking my sleep with Sleep As Android and just purchased their Sleep Mask which connects with USB OTG, that will probably be a review later on.

I have finished reading Sam Harris's *Waking Up*, so I will try to meditate more.
Luckily, he has some guided meditation audio files to get started, and apparently a mobile app will be coming out.
