<p>I am interested in the areas of computer architecture, neuroscience, DNA sequencing/computing, biomedical imaging/sensors, and photonics/optics. Many of my ideal research areas or career paths involve the intersection of these topics, such as photonic integration, neuromorphic chips, neuroimaging, and optogenetics. I am also interested in topics at the intersection of neuroscience and computation, such as neural networks, pattern recognition, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. To this end, I graduated in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois specializing in biomedical optics. In Fall 2016, I will be entering the Electrical Engineering doctoral program at Stanford University.</p>
<p>At Illinois, I served as President of the <a href="http://hkn.illinois.edu">IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu Alpha Chapter at UIUC</a>, worked in Prof. Gabriel Popescu's <a href="http://light.ece.illinois.edu">Quantiative Light Imaging Lab</a> and with a technology transfer startup for the lab, <a href="http://phioptics.com/">Phi Optics</a>.</p>
<p>I additionally served as President of the newly-formed <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/neuroengineering/">Neuroengineering Student Association (NESA)</a></p>
<p>After graduating from Illinois, I interned with the Synapse Biology group (PI: Prof. Stephen J Smith) at the <a href="http://alleninstitute.org">Allen Institute for Brain Science</a> under Forrest Collman & Sharmishtaa Seshamani</p>
