<p>I am interested in the areas of computer architecture, neuroscience, biomedical imaging, and photonics/optics. Many of my ideal research areas or career paths involve the intersection of these topics, such as photonic integration, neuromorphic chips, neuroimaging, and optogenetics. I am also interested in topics at the intersection of neuroscience and computation, such as neural networks, pattern recognition, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. To this end, I am majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Bioengineering at the University of Illinois. </p>
<p>I currently serve as President of the <a href="http://hkn.illinois.edu">IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu Alpha Chapter at UIUC</a> and works in Prof. Gabriel Popescu's <a href="http://light.ece.illinois.edu">Quantiative Light Imaging Lab</a></p>
<p>I additionally serve as President of the newly-formed <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/neuroengineering/">Neuroengineering Student Association (NESA)</a></p>
