My coursework mostly surrounds analog circuits in my MSEE and biomedical optics, imaging, and computer engineering in my undergrad in CompE at UIUC. Also, I did a bit of biology and machine learning on the side. Here are a few significant ones:

# Computer Engineering
 * ECE 411: Computer Organization and Design
   
   This course is an intensive introduction to the fundamentals of computer architecture. Relying heavily upon the elementary principles taught in ECE 220, ECE 385, and ECE 391, we will discuss the basic design, or architecture, of computing hardware. Computer systems involve architecture design at many levels. We will focus on the instruction set architecture (ISA) level (the interface between the software and computing hardware) and the microarchitecture level (the computing hardware itself). We will examine to some extent, the level above the instruction set (the programming language level) and the level below the microarchitecture (the logic gate level) in order to deepen our understanding of computing systems. This course has a demanding design component; you will implement some of the basic concepts presented in lecture using real hardware design tools.

 * ECE 391: Computer Systems Engineering

   This class will introduce you to the concepts and abstractions central to the development of modern computing systems, with an emphasis on the systems software that controls interaction between devices and other hardware and application programs. We will cover input-output semantics, synchronization, interrupts, multitasking, virtualization of resources, protection, and resource management concepts. You will also be introduced to network and storage device abstractions. In terms of practical skills, you will be exposed to software development tools for source control, debugging, dependency management, and compilation, and will work in the context of a real operating system executing in a virtual machine. You will also develop software analysis skills as well as team-based development and testing skills.
   The list of topics includes:
    * x86 assembly: review of basic constructs and structures, interfacing C to assembly, macros, stack frame and calling convention
    * system software basics: resource management, virtualization, protection, system call interface, asynchronous and synchronous interactions
    * simple data structures: queues, heaps, stacks, lists
    * interrupts and exceptions: controlling generation and handling, chaining, cleanup code, interactions with device functionality, interrupt controllers
    * synchronization: primitives, memory semantics, mutual exclusion, semaphores, scheduling, race conditions
    * virtualization of the CPU: processes and scheduling
    * I/O interface: file descriptors, buffering, control operations
    * device programming: basic abstractions, character and block devices, device driver development process
    * user-level programming interfaces for file and network I/O, relationship to kernel I/O abstractions
    * virtualization of memory: hardware support and software abstractions
    * signals: semantics, generation, and delivery
    * file system abstractions and disk layout

* ECE 408: Applied Parallel Programming

  Parallel programming with emphasis on developing applications for processors with many computation cores. Computational thinking, forms of parallelism, programming models, mapping computations to parallel hardware, efficient data structures, paradigms for efficient parallel algorithms, and application case studies.

# Circuits

* EE214A: Fundamentals of Analog Integrated Circuit Design

  This course provides a comprehensive introduction to various aspects of modern digital integrated circuit design. Navigate through the maze of tools, technologies and techniques including circuit components, component variations and practical design paradigms. Learn how to analyze, simulate and design a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) analog integrated circuit.

* EE214B: Advanced Integrated Circuit Design

  The advanced treatment of analog integrated circuit design using noise and distortion constrained wideband amplification presents complex subjects of electronic noise, distortion and feedback in a holistic framework that is unavailable in commonly used textbooks. Designed to bridge the separation of introductory material on integrated circuit analysis and performance-driven design, this content will prove invaluable to those in the field. 
This course is a must for students who wish to acquire a deep understanding of the fundamental effects that limit the performance of high-speed transistor circuits commonly found in electronic products. Knowledge acquired will prepare students for graduate study at an advanced/300 level and prepare them for a successful career as a transistor-level integrated circuit designer.
